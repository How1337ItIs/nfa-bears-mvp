## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM BUILD SESSION

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Next.js 15 + React 19** creates peer dependency conflicts
   - Solution: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for all installs

2. **Privy v3 + Wagmi integration** requires specific setup
   - Import WagmiProvider from `@privy-io/wagmi`
   - Import hooks from standard `wagmi`
   - This split is intentional

3. **Static pre-rendering** conflicts with Web3 hooks
   - Solution: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on all Web3 pages

4. **Conflicting configs** cause infinite restart loops
   - Root cause: `next.config.mjs` overriding `next.config.js`
   - Solution: Delete .mjs, use .js with proper webpack config

### Cultural Alignment
5. **"Fuck crypto, real family shit"** philosophy evident throughout
   - Miracle SBT naming (free ticket tradition)
   - Person-to-person onboarding
   - Soulbound tokens (anti-speculation)
   - Parking lot culture preservation

6. **Pill Triad** (Clear, Rave, Light) maps to:
   - Clear: Open source, transparent
   - Rave: Joyful UX, dancing bear
   - Light: Transformative onboarding experience

## 🎨 ARCHITECTURAL HIGHLIGHTS

### The 60-Second Miracle Stack

**Frontend**:
- Next.js 15 App Router
- Privy v3 authentication
- Wagmi v2 + Viem blockchain hooks
- React 19 with Tailwind CSS
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Backend**:
- Next.js API routes
- Upstash Redis (invite storage)
- Berachain RPC (blockchain reads)
- Relayer wallet (gasless minting)

**Security Layers**:
1. GPS verification (Haversine distance)
2. HMAC-signed invite codes
3. Rate limiting (Upstash)
4. One-time code consumption
5. 15-minute expiry
6. In-person verification (ambassador present)

**Smart Contract**:
- ERC-721 Miracle Membership SBT
- Soulbound (non-transferable)
- `mintMembership(address)` - Relayer only
- `hasMinted(address)` - Public read

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Non-Blocking (Acceptable for Pilot)
1. **Mock Data in Dashboards**
   - POAT collections show placeholders
   - Community stats are hardcoded
   - **Impact**: UI looks populated, real data coming

2. **Genesis Bears Not Deployed**
   - Mint page is placeholder
   - Can't verify Genesis holders yet
   - **Impact**: Pilot uses SBT only (intended)

3. **Discord Manual Invites**
   - No OAuth/bot automation
   - Ambassadors share link manually
   - **Impact**: Extra 10 seconds, acceptable

4. **No Analytics Dashboard**
   - Relying on Vercel analytics
   - No real-time mint tracking UI
   - **Impact**: Check blockchain explorer manually

### Development Warnings (Ignorable)
- "turbopack" config warning → Non-breaking
- React Native async storage → Handled via webpack
- Thirdweb peer dependencies → Using --legacy-peer-deps

---
