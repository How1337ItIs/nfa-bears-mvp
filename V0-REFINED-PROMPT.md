# V0 NFA Bears: Underwater Liquid Light Show PWA

## üéØ MISSION
Transform NFA Bears into a **mobile-first PWA** with a **high-psychedelic "underwater liquid light show"** aesthetic. Think Grateful Dead parking lot meets modern mobile app - authentic Deadhead culture through cutting-edge design.

**Cultural Foundation**: "Grateful Dead parking lot meets Web3" ‚Ä¢ Anti-speculation, family-first ‚Ä¢ "Fuck crypto, real family shit"

üè† Home     üì± Scan     üé™ Dashboard     üë§ Profile

Header:

## üåä VISUAL THEME: UNDERWATER LIQUID LIGHT

### Core Concept
**"Oil projector light show underwater"** - Caustic water light patterns + morphing oil film blobs + fish/terrapin motifs swimming through the interface.

### Color System (EXACT VALUES)
```css
--background: #000011     /* Deep space base */
--primary: #1a1aff       /* Electric blue - main interactive color */
--accent: #ff3366        /* Rosy red - hot accents only, never glows */
--highlight: #ffff00     /* Bright yellow - celebration dots only */
--success: #00ff88       /* Neon green - confirmations */
--text: #ffffff          /* Pure white */
--text-muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)
```

**Usage Rules**:
- **Blue (#1a1aff)**: Primary actions, glows, focus states, navigation
- **Red (#ff3366)**: Urgent actions, hot accents, NEVER glows (always flat/satin)
- **Yellow (#ffff00)**: Tiny celebration elements only (badges, success sparkles)

### Background Layer System
```
Layer 1: Deep Space Base
- Solid #000011 or subtle radial gradient
- Anchors the entire composition

Layer 2: Caustic Water Light  
- SVG turbulence or animated caustic pattern
- Slow drift animation (10-12s loop)
- Blue-tinted, screen blend mode, 40% opacity
- Creates that "underwater ripple" effect

Layer 3: Oil Film Morphing Blobs
- Large amorphous shapes that slowly morph (18-20s)
- Blue centers with transparent-to-red edge halos
- Use existing .liquid-morph class
- Gentle chromatic aberration (blue shift only)

Layer 4: Micro Particles (Optional Enhancement)
- Small bubble/star particles
- Very slow vertical drift
- 8% opacity maximum
```

## üêü CULTURAL MOTIFS: FISH + TERRAPINS

### Symbol Library
Create these as **SVG outline graphics**:
- **Fish Pair**: Yin/yang swimming pattern (hero backgrounds)
- **Single Terrapin**: Left and right facing (badges, empty states)  
- **Fish School**: 3-5 small fish (loading animations)
- **13-Point Lightning Bolt**: Exact Grateful Dead iconography (watermarks at 5% opacity)

### Motif Usage Patterns
```
Hero Sections:
- Large fish pair in slow orbital dance behind content
- Very subtle, 15% opacity maximum

Navigation/Badges:
- Terrapin medallions for achievements/status
- Fish pair for community/social features
- 13-point bolt for authentic Deadhead elements

Empty States:
- Single terrapin holding message/icon
- "Nothing here yet" becomes "Terrapin taking a break"

Loading States:
- Fish school gentle swimming animation
- Bubbles rising effect for longer loads
```

## üé® COMPONENT DESIGN SYSTEM

### Preserve Existing Classes
```css
.glassmorphic {
  /* Keep: backdrop-blur(10px), rgba borders */
  /* Add: subtle scale-tessellation texture on large cards */
}

.glow-text {
  /* Blue glow for headings only */
  /* Red text stays flat/satin - no glow ever */
}

.liquid-morph {
  /* Apply to: background blobs, hero masks, section dividers */
  /* 0.3s for interactive, infinite slow for decorative */
}
```

### Button System
```
Primary Button:
- Electric blue solid background
- White text, subtle scale(1.02) on hover
- Soft blue outer glow on active
- Fish pair micro-animation on press

Secondary Button:  
- Glassmorphic outline with blue stroke
- Hover shows blue inner glow
- Terrapin icon optional

Critical/Destructive:
- Rosy red solid (#ff3366)
- Dark text (#000011) 
- NO glow effects (red never glows)
- Single red spark ring on press

Disabled:
- Lower opacity, remove all effects
```

### Card/Container System
```
Standard Card:
- .glassmorphic base
- Blue focus ring (2px, #1a1aff)
- Optional terrapin watermark (3% opacity)
- Dividers: rgba(255,255,255,0.15)

Hero Card:
- Fish pair background motif
- Stronger blue glow on focus
- Caustic light overlay subtle

Status Cards:
- Success: Green accent border
- Warning: Yellow dot indicator  
- Error: Red flat border (no glow)
```

## üìã SPECIFIC SCREEN DESIGNS

## ‚ö° ANIMATION & MOTION

### Background Motion
- **Caustic ripples**: 10-12s slow loop
- **Oil blobs**: 18-20s morphing cycle  
- **Particle drift**: Very slow vertical float
- **Parallax**: 2-3 layers, 1-3px scroll drift

### Interactive Motion
- **Button press**: Blue pulse + scale(1.02)
- **Red button press**: Single red spark ring (dissipates quickly)
- **Focus states**: Blue glow intensity increase
- **Loading**: Fish school gentle swim or terrapin walk cycle

### Performance Considerations
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Pause morphing animations */
  /* Reduce parallax to zero */
  /* Keep essential UI feedback only */
}
```
