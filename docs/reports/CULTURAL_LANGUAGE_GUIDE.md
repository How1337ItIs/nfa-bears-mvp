# Cultural Language Guide
**Embodying "Fuck Crypto, Real Family Shit" in Every Word**

## üéØ Philosophy

Language isn't decoration. It's how values get transmitted. Every button, every error message, every notification is an opportunity to reinforce culture.

**The Shift**: From tech-speak to community-speak
- Not "users" ‚Üí "family members", "Heads", "Bears"
- Not "NFT" ‚Üí "Miracle", "membership", "proof you were there"
- Not "wallet" ‚Üí "your space", "your ticket"
- Not "transaction" ‚Üí "welcome", "miracle", "verification"

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Already Changed)

### Success Page
- **Before**: "You got an NFT!"
- **After**: "You're on the bus! You just got miracled into the community"
- **Why**: Connects to Deadhead tradition, emphasizes belonging

### Ambassador Portal
- **Before**: "Generate New Invite"
- **After**: "‚ö° Miracle Someone In"
- **Why**: Active voice, cultural reference, emphasizes gift-giving

### Ambassador Loading State
- **Before**: "Generating..."
- **After**: "Generating your miracle..."
- **Why**: Maintains cultural frame even in loading states

## üìù RECOMMENDED CHANGES

### Homepage

**Current**:
```
"Connect & Enter"
```

**Suggested Options**:
```
"Get on the Bus" (Kesey reference)
"Join the Family" (direct, warm)
"Enter the Lot" (parking lot reference)
"Connect & Ride" (journey metaphor)
```

**Reasoning**: "Connect" is web3-speak. Use language that evokes belonging or journey.

---

### Dashboard & Navigation

**Current**: Generic tech terms
**Suggested**:

| Current | Suggested | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| "Dashboard" | "Your Space on the Bus" | Journey metaphor, ownership |
| "Member Profile" | "Your Spot in the Family" | Relational, not transactional |
| "Settings" | "Your Gear" | Deadhead slang for belongings |
| "Logout" | "Step Off (for now)" | Temporary, welcoming return |
| "Edit Profile" | "Share Your Story" | Narrative-focused |

---

### Vendor Verification

**Current**: Technical verification language
**Suggested**:

**For Vendors:**
```
Before: "Scan QR Code to Verify Membership"
After: "Welcome a Family Member"

Before: "‚úì Verified - 10% Discount Approved"
After: "‚úì They're Family - Show Some Love (10% off)"

Before: "‚ùå No Membership Found"
After: "Not a member yet - Invite them to join!"
```

**For Members:**
```
Before: "Show this QR code to vendor"
After: "Show this to your Bear-friendly vendors"

Before: "Membership QR Code"
After: "Your Family Discount Code"
```

**Why**: Transform from anonymous transaction to recognized relationship

### Error Messages (The Dead Banter Approach)

**Standard Tech Errors ‚Üí Grateful Dead Stage Banter**

I see in git history there was a "dead-banter-complete" branch. This is BRILLIANT. Here's the approach:

**Network Errors**:
```
Before: "Connection failed. Please try again."
After: "Looks like we're having some technical difficulties...
        Just like that time the power went out mid-Scarlet Begonias.
        Give it a minute and we'll be back jamming."
```

**GPS Errors**:
```
Before: "Location not verified"
After: "You seem to be outside the venue radius, friend.
        Get a little closer to the action and try again.
        The miracle happens face-to-face!"
```

**Already Have SBT**:
```
Before: "This wallet already has a membership NFT"
After: "Looks like you're already on the bus!
        One miracle per person - that's the deal.
        But you can miracle your friends! üêª"
```

**Invite Expired**:
```
Before: "Invite code has expired"
After: "This miracle ticket expired (they only last 15 minutes).
        Ask your ambassador to generate a fresh one.
        Good things come to those who wait... but not too long!"
```

**Rate Limit Hit**:
```
Before: "Too many requests. Please wait."
After: "Whoa there, Space Cowboy! üöÄ
        Even Jerry took breaks between jams.
        Cool down for a minute and try again."
```

---

### Onboarding Flow Language

**Invite Redemption Page** (`/invite/[code]`):

```
Status: "Verifying..."
‚Üí "Checking if the miracle is legit..."

Status: "Checking GPS..."
‚Üí "Making sure you're actually here (parking lot rules!)"

Status: "Creating wallet..."
‚Üí "Setting up your space on the bus..."

## üîß Implementation Pattern

For each page/component:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before
<button>Generate Invite</button>

// ‚úÖ After
<button>‚ö° Miracle Someone In</button>

// Document the change
// Old: "Generate Invite" (generic web3)
// New: "Miracle Someone In" (Deadhead gift economy)
// Reasoning: Emphasizes generosity over transaction
```

---

## üìñ The Why

**This isn't branding exercise. It's cultural preservation.**

Every time someone sees "Miracle Someone In" instead of "Generate Invite", they're reminded:
- This is about generosity
- There's history here (miracle tradition)
- This is different from other crypto projects

The language teaches newcomers what the community values, without them having to read documentation.

**UX copy IS cultural transmission.**

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Audit all components** for generic tech language
2. **Update systematically** page by page
3. **Test with real Deadheads** - does it resonate?
4. **Iterate based on feedback** - is it authentic or trying too hard?

**Remember**: The best language feels natural, not forced. If it makes you smile or nod, it's probably right. If it feels cringy or corporate, keep workshopping.

**The voice should sound like a Deadhead explaining NFA Bears to another Deadhead in the parking lot.**

That's the bar. üêª‚ö°
