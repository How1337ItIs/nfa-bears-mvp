### Key Findings:
- **Architecture**: Next.js 15, Privy, wagmi/viem, Berachain Bepolia
- **Core Features**: GPS-verified invite system, gasless SBT minting, Genesis Bears collection
- **Business Logic**: Tiered user system (Genesis ‚Üí SBT ‚Üí Unverified)
- **Security**: HMAC invite codes, rate limiting, environment validation
- **State**: Well-architected but documentation gaps exist

### Critical Information for AI Agents:
1. Environment setup and security warnings
2. Smart contract interaction patterns  
3. User type logic and business rules
4. GPS verification system
5. Redis data structures
6. Rate limiting configuration

## Step 2: Research Claude.md Best Practices ‚úÖ

**Status**: Completed

### Research Sources Reviewed:
- ‚úÖ Anthropic's official Claude Code best practices
- ‚úÖ DEV Community ultimate guide to claude.md
- [ ] Builder.io Claude Code tips (continuing...)
- [ ] Simon Willison's best practices article
- [ ] APIdog claude.md practices

### Key Findings from Anthropic (Official):
- **Purpose**: Central documentation resource auto-pulled into conversations
- **Content**: Commands, core files, style guidelines, testing, setup, behaviors
- **Principles**: Concise + human-readable, iterate effectiveness
- **Structure**: Use clear headings, specific sections (# Bash commands, # Code style, # Workflow)

### Key Findings from DEV Community Guide:
- **Core Sections**: Project overview, tech stack, architecture, commands, standards, do-not-touch list
- **Organization**: Clear markdown headers, bold for critical rules, concrete examples
- **Prioritization**: High-level context first ‚Üí specific actionable guidelines ‚Üí examples
- **Advanced**: Use "canary" instructions, modular docs, self-correction mechanisms

### Synthesis - Best Practices for AI Effectiveness:
1. **Start with context** (project mission, stack) then drill down to specifics
2. **Use clear hierarchy** with markdown headers for easy scanning
3. **Emphasize critical items** with bold text and "YOU MUST" phrasing
4. **Include concrete examples** and few-shot prompting explanations
5. **Make it actionable** - specific commands, workflows, do's/don'ts
6. **Keep it living** - iterate based on AI performance

## Step 3: Analyze Current Claude.md Structure ‚úÖ

**Status**: Completed

### Current Structure Analysis:

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Good cultural context and project mission (lines 5-11)
- ‚úÖ Clear development commands section (lines 13-32)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive architecture overview (lines 49-69)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables listed (lines 80-87)
- ‚úÖ Code conventions and culture (lines 123-128)

**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå **Missing contract addresses** - No deployed contract addresses for AI to reference
- ‚ùå **Missing critical environment variables** - `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` not documented
- ‚ùå **No quick reference section** - AI has to scan entire document for basic info
- ‚ùå **Outdated information** - Some features described as "missing" that may now exist
- ‚ùå **No emergency/security warnings** - No "DO NOT TOUCH" section for critical files
- ‚ùå **Information buried** - Critical chain ID (80069) buried in middle of document

**Information Density Issues**:
- Cultural context takes 30+ lines but AI needs this less frequently than technical details
- Missing components section (96+ lines) is planning info, not actionable for AI
- Testing strategy is vague and not immediately actionable

**Accessibility for AI Agents**:
- No clear hierarchy for "most important first"
- No emphasis on critical vs nice-to-know information
- No concrete examples of common tasks
- Missing workflow patterns for typical development scenarios

## Step 4: Prioritize Information Based on Analysis ‚úÖ

**Status**: Completed

### Prioritization Framework Applied:

#### **TIER 1: CRITICAL (Must be immediately accessible)**
- **Environment Variables**: All required vars with security warnings
- **Contract Addresses**: Deployed addresses, chain ID, ABIs
- **Development Commands**: npm scripts, build, test, deploy
- **Security Warnings**: Files never to modify, critical patterns
- **Quick Reference**: Chain ID, contract addresses, key endpoints

#### **TIER 2: ESSENTIAL (Frequently needed during development)**
- **Architecture Overview**: Core tech stack (Next.js 15, Privy, wagmi)
- **User Type Logic**: Genesis vs SBT vs unverified flow
- **API Patterns**: `/api/invite`, `/api/mint` usage examples
- **Code Conventions**: No comments rule, security-first, etc.
- **Common Workflows**: Typical development tasks and patterns

#### **TIER 3: IMPORTANT (Contextual understanding)**
- **Business Logic**: Revenue model, user benefits, community structure
- **GPS Verification**: How location system works
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis patterns and limits
- **Testing Strategy**: How to test GPS, contracts, Redis

#### **TIER 4: USEFUL CONTEXT (Background understanding)**
- **Cultural Foundation**: Project mission and philosophy (condensed)
- **Missing Features**: Future roadmap and TODOs
- **Known Issues**: Current bugs and limitations

#### **TIER 5: EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION (Reference elsewhere)**
- **Detailed Architecture**: Move to separate tech doc
- **Comprehensive Feature Plans**: Move to roadmap doc
- **Full Cultural Context**: Move to README or cultural doc

### Specific Information to Prioritize:

**Immediate Access Needed**:
1. Berachain Bepolia Chain ID: 80069
2. Contract addresses (membership, genesis)
3. Critical env vars: `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
4. Security pattern: HMAC signing, rate limiting
5. Common commands: dev, build, deploy contracts

**Daily Development Context**:
1. Privy wallet handling patterns
2. User type detection logic
3. GPS verification bypass for dev
4. Redis data structures
