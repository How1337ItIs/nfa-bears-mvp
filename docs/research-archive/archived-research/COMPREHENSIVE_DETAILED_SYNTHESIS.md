## üéØ Project Identity & Cultural Foundation

### Core Mission: "Not Fade Away Bears"
**Triple Entendre Identity:**
- **Non-Fungible Acid Bears** - Psychedelic NFT collection
- **Not Fade Away** - Grateful Dead anthem reference  
- **Not Financial Advice** - Anti-speculation stance

**Cultural Philosophy:**
- **Mantra**: "Fuck crypto, real family shit" - prioritizing human connection over hype

- **Home Chain**: Berachain (Bong Bears' L1 blockchain)
- **Artists**: Pixelw00k (primary wook-flavored pixel art) + gumilady (Mibera bridge art)

### The Pill Triad Philosophy
**Three complementary states of consciousness:**

1. **Clear** (inspired by Milady): Radical transparency in governance, open-source code, public books
2. **Rave** (from Mibera): Collective euphoria, shared joy, tie-dyes, dancing bears, jam sessions
3. **Light** (NFA's contribution): Ego-melting insight, transformation, core sigil and storyline

### Cultural Authenticity Measures
- **710 Significance**: Homage to 710 Ashbury Street (Grateful Dead's communal house) + "OIL" upside-down Easter egg
- **Kaironic Time**: Lore resurfaces non-linearly in perpetual remix
- **Anti-Corporate Stance**: Grassroots alternative to polished Dead-themed experiences
- **Community-First**: "By the fans, for the fans" magic preservation

## üîí Security Architecture & Anti-Fraud Systems

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities (Fixed)
**1. Hardcoded Private Key Exposure (CRITICAL - FIXED)**
- **Location**: `hardhat.config.cjs:10`
- **Issue**: Private key hardcoded in version control
- **Fix**: Moved to environment variable with validation
- **Impact**: Complete compromise prevention

**2. Missing HMAC Signature Verification (CRITICAL - FIXED)**
- **Location**: `app/api/invite/route.ts` (GET endpoint)
- **Issue**: HMAC signatures generated but never verified
- **Fix**: Added signature verification with timestamp validation
- **Impact**: Complete invite system security restoration

**3. Weak Secret Key Fallbacks (CRITICAL - FIXED)**

## üé® Psychedelic UI Design System

### Visual Theme: "Underwater Liquid Light Show"
**Core Concept**: Oil projector light show underwater - caustic water light patterns + morphing oil film blobs + fish/terrapin motifs

**Color System (Exact Values):**
```css
--background: #000011     /* Deep space base */
--primary: #1a1aff       /* Electric blue - main interactive color */
--accent: #ff3366        /* Rosy red - hot accents only, never glows */
--highlight: #ffff00     /* Bright yellow - celebration dots only */
--success: #00ff88       /* Neon green - confirmations */
--text: #ffffff          /* Pure white */
--text-muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)
```

**Usage Rules:**
- **Blue (#1a1aff)**: Primary actions, glows, focus states, navigation
- **Red (#ff3366)**: Urgent actions, hot accents, NEVER glows (always flat/satin)
- **Yellow (#ffff00)**: Tiny celebration elements only (badges, success sparkles)

### Background Layer System
**Layer 1: Deep Space Base**
- Solid #000011 or subtle radial gradient
- Anchors the entire composition

**Layer 2: Caustic Water Light**
- SVG turbulence or animated caustic pattern
- Slow drift animation (10-12s loop)
- Blue-tinted, screen blend mode, 40% opacity
- Creates "underwater ripple" effect

**Layer 3: Oil Film Morphing Blobs**
- Large amorphous shapes that slowly morph (18-20s)
- Blue centers with transparent-to-red edge halos
- Use existing .liquid-morph class
- Gentle chromatic aberration (blue shift only)

**Layer 4: Micro Particles (Optional Enhancement)**
- Small bubble/star particles
- Very slow vertical drift
- 8% opacity maximum

### Cultural Motifs: Fish + Terrapins
**Symbol Library (SVG outline graphics):**
- **Fish Pair**: Yin/yang swimming pattern (hero backgrounds)
- **Single Terrapin**: Left and right facing (badges, empty states)
- **Fish School**: 3-5 small fish (loading animations)
- **13-Point Lightning Bolt**: Exact Grateful Dead iconography (watermarks at 5% opacity)

### Advanced CSS Animations
**Expert-Level Psychedelic Effects:**
```css
