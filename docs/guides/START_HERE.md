## 🎯 What This Project Is About

**Mission**: Preserve Grateful Dead parking lot culture using Web3 as a tool for authentic IRL connections

**Core Philosophy**: "Fuck crypto, real family shit"
- Not about speculation or hype
- About community, mutual aid, and keeping the spirit alive
- Blockchain is invisible - human connection is everything

**The 60-Second Miracle**:
GPS-verified onboarding at live events where people get free Miracle SBT memberships in under 60 seconds, just like getting miracled a ticket in the old days.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### **Your Redis credentials might be expired/invalid**

The environment variables `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are configured but **not connecting**.

**Fix in 10 minutes**:

1. Go to https://upstash.com/ and log in
2. Check if your Redis database exists
3. If not, create new database:
   - Name: `nfa-bears-pilot`
   - Type: Regional
   - Region: US West (or closest to you)
4. Copy the **full** REST URL and TOKEN
5. Replace in `.env` file (make sure you copy COMPLETE values)
6. Restart server

**Test it works**:
```bash
cd nfa-bears-mvp
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/invite -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"venueId":"local-dev","latitude":37.7749,"longitude":-122.4194}'
```

If you get JSON with QR code = ✅ WORKING!

**See**: `REDIS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed step-by-step
