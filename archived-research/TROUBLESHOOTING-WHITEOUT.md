# White Screen Issue Troubleshooting Log

## Problem Description
- User clicks on fluid simulation
- Entire screen turns bright white instead of localized color
- White slowly fades to pink but lingers with multiple clicks
- Expected: Localized colored fluid injection that blends naturally

## Timeline of Attempts

### Initial Configuration (Working baseline)
```javascript
simResolution: 128,
dyeResolution: 512,
velocityDissipation: 0.98,
densityDissipation: 0.92,
splatRadius: 0.25,
splatForce: 6000,
colorPalette: ['#ff0080', '#0080ff', '#80ff00']
```
**Result**: "looks cool but not exactly oily or drippy yet"

### Attempt 1: Reduce Accumulation
```javascript
densityDissipation: 0.85,  // Was 0.92
splatForce: 4000           // Was 6000
```
**Result**: "just looks white now"

### Attempt 2: More Aggressive Fade
```javascript
densityDissipation: 0.75,  // Was 0.85
splatRadius: 0.1,          // Was 0.25
splatForce: 2000           // Was 4000
```
**Result**: "still every several seconds or so it seems to refresh and be much brighter"

### Attempt 3: Single Color Test
```javascript
colorPalette: ['#ff3366'],  // Single color
colorful: false,
colorUpdateSpeed: 0,
densityDissipation: 0.5    // Very aggressive
```
**Result**: "the flashes still cover the screen"

### Attempt 4: Tiny Splats
```javascript
splatRadius: 0.05,         // Very small
splatForce: 1000          // Reduced
```
**Result**: "I think maybe just make the splats much smaller" → still flashing

### Attempt 5: Ultra-Gentle Parameters
```javascript
splatRadius: 0.05,         // Kept small
splatForce: 200,          // Drastically reduced
velocityDissipation: 0.4,
densityDissipation: 0.5,
dx/dy: ±20                // Minimal velocity
```
**Result**: "all I see is black until I click. when I click, the entire screen is washed out white"

### Attempt 6: VERSION 1.2 (Current)
- Same ultra-gentle parameters as Attempt 5
- **Result**: "nope, no real change"

## Key Observations
1. **White covers entire screen**: Not localized to click area
2. **Progressive accumulation**: Multiple clicks make white linger longer
3. **Parameter reduction ineffective**: Even tiny forces cause screen-wide white
4. **Fading behavior**: White slowly transitions to intended color
5. **Black baseline**: No visible fluid until interaction

## Hypotheses
1. **Library bug**: webgl-fluid-enhanced may have color accumulation issue
2. **Additive blending**: Colors might be adding to white instead of mixing
3. **Brightness scaling**: Library might be applying brightness multiplier
4. **Canvas clearing**: Background might not be clearing properly

### Attempt 7: Dark Color Diagnostic
```javascript
colorPalette: ['#220044'],  // Very dark purple
brightness: 0.8
```
**Result**: "only a very bright purple which fades to darker purple and then to black upon click. covers the whole screen still, at first, but shrinks as it fades"

### Attempt 8: Low Brightness Test
```javascript
colorPalette: ['#ff3366'],  // Pink
brightness: 0.1             // Very low
```
**Result**: "maybe it's not 'brightness' technically, but the appearance of the entire screen being saturated in one color appears very 'bright' to my human eyeball. I think localization is more the issue"

## Key Diagnostic Finding
✅ **LOCALIZATION ISSUE CONFIRMED**: The real problem is that color spreads across the entire screen instead of staying localized to the click area. The "brightness" perception is caused by screen-wide color saturation, not intensity scaling.

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The webgl-fluid-enhanced library has poor localization - splat events are spreading across the entire canvas instead of staying localized, causing:
1. Screen-wide color saturation on any click
2. Colors appearing "bright" because they cover the full screen
3. Need to focus on splat radius, velocity dissipation, and pressure parameters

### Attempt 9: VERSION 4 Localization Test
```javascript
velocityDissipation: 0.9,   // Much higher - contain velocity locally
densityDissipation: 0.3,    // Faster fade to prevent accumulation  
pressure: 0.2,              // Much lower pressure - reduce fluid flow
splatRadius: 0.01,          // Ultra small radius - tiny injection
splatForce: 50,             // Minimal force - gentle injection
curl: 5,                    // Lower curl - reduce turbulence
```
**Debug logs working**: ✅ Full initialization and click tracking confirmed
**Result**: "the color is slightly more localized but still much too big and too white"

### Attempt 10: VERSION 5 Extreme Reduction
```javascript
velocityDissipation: 0.98,  // Extremely high - kill velocity fast
densityDissipation: 0.1,    // Very fast fade to prevent buildup
pressure: 0.05,             // Minimal pressure - almost no flow
splatRadius: 0.005,         // Microscopic radius - pinpoint injection
splatForce: 10,             // Tiny force - barely visible
colorPalette: ['#330011'],  // Very dark red
brightness: 0.3,            // Much lower brightness
```
**Result**: "still pretty big but better"

### Attempt 11: VERSION 6 Absolute Minimum
```javascript
velocityDissipation: 0.99,  // Maximum - kill velocity instantly
densityDissipation: 0.05,   // Maximum fade - disappears almost instantly
pressure: 0.01,             // Absolute minimum pressure
splatRadius: 0.001,         // Absolute minimum radius - tiny dot
splatForce: 1,              // Absolute minimum force - barely a whisper
curl: 0,                    // Zero curl - no turbulence at all
colorPalette: ['#110000'],  // Almost black with tiny red hint
brightness: 0.1,            // Minimum brightness
```
**Result**: ✅ **BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY**: "I can see a localized pixel sized distortion at the point of click but elsewhere on the screen there's a much bigger distortion"

## Key Finding: COORDINATE OFFSET BUG IDENTIFIED
✅ **ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: The library has a consistent coordinate offset:
- **Top left click**: Distortion appears at top left (correct)
- **Top right click**: Distortion appears ~1/5th screen width to the left (offset)
- **Pattern**: Always offset approximately 1/5th screen width to the left, except at extreme left

This suggests the webgl-fluid-enhanced library is applying an incorrect coordinate transformation that shifts X coordinates.

### Attempt 12: VERSION 9 Coordinate Compensation (20% offset)
```javascript
const offsetX = rect.width * 0.2; // 1/5th screen width compensation
const compensatedX = rawX + offsetX;
```
**Result**: "it's less far to the left now but a still see a pixel wide distortion and then a much larger, maybe about a third the size of the 'version' etc black box, distortion now just maybe a couple dozen pixels or so (very rough guess) to the left"

✅ **MAJOR PROGRESS**: Offset reduced from ~1/5th screen width to ~couple dozen pixels!

## Next Diagnostic Steps
- [x] Test with very dark color (#220044) → CONFIRMED brightness scaling issue
- [x] Test with brightness: 0.1 → CONFIRMED real issue is localization, not brightness  
- [x] Test ultra-small splat radius (0.01) → TESTING NOW
- [x] Test much higher velocity dissipation (0.9) → TESTING NOW
- [x] Test lower pressure (0.2) → TESTING NOW
- [ ] Based on user feedback, adjust parameters further or try different approach
