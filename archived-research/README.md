# Archived Research Documents

This directory contains research documents that have been superseded by the **MASTER_LIQUID_LIGHT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md**.

## Why These Were Archived

### Incomplete/Superseded Synthesis Documents
- `COMPREHENSIVE_APPROACH_SYNTHESIS.md` - Incomplete early synthesis attempt
- `COMPREHENSIVE_DETAILED_SYNTHESIS.md` - Partial research compilation  
- `COMPLETE_MARKDOWN_SYNTHESIS.md` - Early documentation attempt
- `ULTIMATE_COMPREHENSIVE_SYNTHESIS.md` - Another incomplete synthesis

**Replaced by**: `MASTER_LIQUID_LIGHT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (complete synthesis)

### Outdated ChatGPT-Based Approaches
- `CHATGPT_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md` - Complex multi-tool approach
- `CHATGPT_LIQUID_LIGHT_RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md` - ChatGPT integration workflow
- `V0_COMPONENT_PROMPTS_WITH_IMAGES.md` - ChatGPT + v0 workflow
- `V0_IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md` - Multi-tool coordination

**Why Archived**: User feedback indicated these approaches were "too complex" and preferred v0-only approach.

### Superseded v0 Prompts
- `AUTHENTIC_LIQUID_LIGHT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Earlier implementation approach
- `V0_AUTHENTIC_LIQUID_LIGHT_PROMPTS.md` - Older v0 prompts
- `V0_LIQUID_LIGHT_COMPONENT_PROMPTS.md` - Component-based approach

**Replaced by**: `V0_LIQUID_LIGHT_ENGINE_MASTER_PROMPT.md` (definitive single prompt)

## Active Research Documents

The following documents remain active and current:

1. **MASTER_LIQUID_LIGHT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md** - Definitive design guide
2. **V0_LIQUID_LIGHT_ENGINE_MASTER_PROMPT.md** - Production v0 prompt
3. **V0_LIQUID_LIGHT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md** - Technical reference for v0
4. **AUTHENTIC_1960s_LIQUID_LIGHT_REFERENCE.md** - Historical foundation
5. **COMPLETE_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_FINAL.md** - Multi-layer architecture guide
6. **ENHANCED_PSYCHEDELIC_RESEARCH.md** - Advanced techniques catalog

All other research documents provide supporting technical details and remain valid reference material.
