## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Claude Code ($20/month)
- **Pros**: Complete autonomous development, superior algorithmic reasoning, proven complex project delivery
- **Cons**: Terminal-based, requires comfort with CLI workflows
- **ROI**: High - can deliver complete liquid light system

### Cursor ($20-$200/month)
- **Pros**: Familiar IDE experience, real-time assistance, great for refinement
- **Cons**: Less autonomous, weaker at complex physics/math
- **ROI**: Medium - excellent for polish and integration

## Conclusion

**Primary Recommendation**: Migrate to **Claude Code** for the liquid light engine development. The research clearly indicates that v0 lacks the computational sophistication required for authentic physics-based liquid light shows.

**Secondary Strategy**: Use **Cursor** for integration, refinement, and developer experience optimization after Claude Code delivers the core engine.

**Timeline**: Claude Code can likely deliver a working liquid light engine in days rather than weeks, given its demonstrated capability with complex visual programming projects.

**Success Probability**: High - Claude Code's proven track record with complex visual programming (games with physics, graphics, controls) directly aligns with liquid light requirements.
